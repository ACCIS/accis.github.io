# ACCIS Research Codes

The [Bristol Composites Institute](http://www.bris.ac.uk/composites/) (ACCIS)
was established in 2017 as a collaboration centre for composites activities
across the University of Bristol.

This page collects the various research codes that ACCIS has made
available to the academic community. The codes are hosted on GitHub via
the [ACCIS organisation page](https://github.com/ACCIS). Please contact us
for access.

| Project | Description |
| --------- | ------------- |
| [DefGen](https://accis.github.io/DefGen/) | This repository encloses a UMAT subroutine for the Finite Element software Abaqus. Given a determined cycle of pressure and temperature, the subroutine allows to make predictions for the the final thickness, fibre volume fraction and defects formed during the processing of composte parts manufactured through the prepreg technology. The code is at the basis of the recent work on defect formation performed at the university of Bristol (references included). |
