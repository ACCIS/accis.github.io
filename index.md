# Bristol Composites Institute

The [Bristol Composites Institute (ACCIS)](http://www.bris.ac.uk/composites),
based at the University of Bristol, UK,cbrings together composites activities
across the University. It combines cutting-edge fundamental science with strong
industrial links for exploitation and technology transfer, and acts as focus
for collaboration, both nationally and internationally.

This page collects the various research codes that ACCIS has made
available to the academic community. The codes are hosted on GitHub via
the [ACCIS organisation page](https://github.com/ACCIS). Please contact
accis-github@bristol.ac.uk for access.

# Software

| Project | Description |
| --------- | ------------- |
| [DefGen](https://accis.github.io/DefGen/) | This repository encloses a UMAT subroutine for the Finite Element software Abaqus. Given a determined cycle of pressure and temperature, the subroutine allows to make predictions for the the final thickness, fibre volume fraction and defects formed during the processing of composte parts manufactured through the prepreg technology. The code is at the basis of the recent work on defect formation performed at the university of Bristol (references included). |
